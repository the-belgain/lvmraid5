# How to test

The easiest way to run the regression tests is to use the Vagrant box provided.  This is a headless Ubuntu box with the required dependencies installed, and the right configuration of virtual hard disks.

* Install VirtualBox
* Install Vagrant
* Clone this repo
* Change to the test/vagrant directory, and run ```vagrant up --provision```
